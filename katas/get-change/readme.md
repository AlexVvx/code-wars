####Description:

Implement a function getChange which takes two arguments: first a cost of the product and second - pay, how much money were inserted in machine and returns the array of change needed.
Machine can return 1c, 5c, 10c, 20c, 50c, 1$. The largest one should be returned first.

####Example:

```js
getChange(1, 1) //=> returns [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
getChange(1, 5) //=> returns [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]
getChange(3.67, 10) //=> returns [3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 6]

```

Good luck
