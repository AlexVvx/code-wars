####Description:

Implement a function that will imitate card game Black Jack and returns game result in text format "Win", "Loose"
or "Push" (when no one wins). Let's take simple rules, like: http://oblackjack.com/pravila_igry/

Assumptions: there are 52 cards in card deck, you playing one on one with a dealer, no split and insurance.

Tips: you can create a function, that will take your cards and dealer cards as argument and return one iteration result
(when the game is over or someone wants to take one more card) and another function, that will randomly take cards from
52 cards deck.


####Example:

```js
blackJack() //=> returns "Win", "Loose" or "Push"
```

Good luck
