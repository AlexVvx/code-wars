####Description:

Harshad numbers are positive numbers that can be divided (without remainder) by the sum of their digits.
Please write function, that will help to check if number is Harshad.

####Example:

```js
isHarshad(10) //=> returns true, because 1 + 0 = 1 and 10 equals 1 * 10
isHarshad(588) //=> returns true, because 5 + 8 + 8 = 21 and 588 equals 21 * 28
isHarshad(19) //=> returns false, because 1 + 9 = 10 and 19 is not divisible by 10
isHarshad(1001) //=> returns false, because 1 + 1 = 2 and 1001 is not divisible by 2
```
