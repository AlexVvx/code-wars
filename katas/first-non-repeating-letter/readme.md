####Description:

Write a function named firstNonRepeatingCharacter that takes a string input, and returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.

For example, if given the input 'stress', the function should return 't', since the letter t only occurs once in the string, and occurs first in the string.

As an added challenge, upper- and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the function should return the correct case for the initial letter.

If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return the empty string ("").

####Example:

```js

firstNonRepeatingCharacter('sTreSS') // 'T'

```

See [tests in first-non-repeating-letter_test.js](https://github.com/AlexVvx/code-wars/tree/master/katas/first-non-repeating-letter/first-non-repeating-letter_test.js)

Good luck
