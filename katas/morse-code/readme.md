####Description:

Please write a simple Morse code decoder.

The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes". For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words.

####Example:

```js
//the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−− ·−−− ··− −·· ·
//NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.
decodeMorse('.... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .') //=> returns 'HEY JUDE'
```
