####Description:

Implement a function that takes two inputs: a string and a character. The function will count the number of times that character appears in the string. The count is case insensitive.

####Example:

```js
countChar("fizzbuzz","z") => 4
countChar("Fancy fifth fly aloof","f") => 5
```

See [tests in count-the-characters_test.js](https://github.com/AlexVvx/code-wars/blob/master/katas/count-the-characters/count-the-characters_test.js)

Good luck
